# TerpCS Hub

TerpCS Hub is a full-stack web application that helps University of Maryland Computer Science students explore and compare courses in one centralized place. The project aggregates course information that is typically scattered across syllabi, PlanetTerp, Testudo, and online forums, and presents it through a clean, searchable interface.

It is currently deployed @ https://class-finder-two.vercel.app/
